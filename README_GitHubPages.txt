# Deploy Interactive Map on GitHub Pages

Follow these steps to host your interactive map online using GitHub Pages:

## 1. Prepare Files
- Ensure you have the file `index.html` (included in this package).

## 2. Create a GitHub Repository
- Go to https://github.com and create a new public repository.
- Name it something like `interactive-map`.

## 3. Upload Files
- Upload `index.html` to the root of your repository.
- Commit the changes.

## 4. Enable GitHub Pages
- Go to **Settings → Pages**.
- Under **Source**, select:
  - Branch: `main`
  - Folder: `/ (root)`
- Click **Save**.

## 5. Get Your Public URL
- After deployment, GitHub will provide a link like:
  `https://yourusername.github.io/interactive-map/`

Since the file is named `index.html`, the map will open directly at this URL.

Enjoy your interactive map!
